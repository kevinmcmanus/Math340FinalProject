1.	What exactly should be covered in the final paper?
intro
derivation
simulations
conclusion

1. How do we verify that our code is working correctly? How do we demonstrate (for grading purposes) that our code is working?
2.	What is the form factor for paper: is pdf of MATLAB LiveScript document OK?
3.	Will Yongcheng or a grader actually be running the code?
4.	What experiments/simulations should we run and document in paper?
5.	How do we demonstrate the animation?
